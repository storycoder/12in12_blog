12 App in 12 Day Blog with Testing
========================

I am following along with Mackenzie Child as he creates his blog app. Go [here](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/2/) if you're interested in following this tutorial.

My personal challenge is to incorporate TDD ahead of the steps Mackenzie calls for. 

Please see the wiki to follow my documentation of my testing steps and all this process is teaching me.
