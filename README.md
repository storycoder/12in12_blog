12in12_blog with Testing
========================

I am following along with Mackenzie Child as he creates his blog app. Go [here](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/2/) to follow along.

My personal challenge is to incorporate TDD ahead of the steps Mackenzie calls for. 

Please see the wiki to follow my documentation of my testing steps and things I've learned.
